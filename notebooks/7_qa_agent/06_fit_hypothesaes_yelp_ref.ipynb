I really liked the atmosphere - lights are dimmed, lots of straight lines with a casual upscale type of feel. The food was really good - my favorites were the UOVO pizza...mmmm the truffled farm egg was soo good...and the wild mushroom arancini. Their drink selection is also very good with seasonal craft beers rotated through out the year. The only reason I'm giving Barbuzzo 4 stars is based on the service. Firstly, we were told we had to order everything at once since the restaurant was full which made us feel very rushed. Secondly, even though we ordered our drinks at the same time as our food, we didn't get our first round of drinks until half way through our entire meal. Finally, our waiter was just not friendly. He seemed annoyed by the fact that we didn't order everything on the menu and made us feel rushed. I would still go back because of the atmosphere[... rest of text is truncated]\n",
      "2. We only had four days in Philly but I am so glad we found Barbuzzo. Small plates, nice wine and beer selection, amazing mixed drinks. Yes, I loved the Old Fashioned. Also the sazerac. Surprisingly the highlight was the pizza, made in a wood fired oven with figs and I forget what. The crust was perfect. We came back the next night for happy hour that starts at 10:30. Made for a rather late night. Sitting at the bar was perfect- all the action is right in front of you. Yes it is small, near the oven it is warm, but what fun.\n",

The sheer amount of ham was just overwhelming and disgusting.  I don't usually leave reviews.

You know how the first blast of a cold shower can refresh the senses?  Amazingly, the room Patricia prepared for me had the same effect... a visual splash of order and crisp linens etc. that actually refreshed.

Fresh veggies nicely laid on top of the red fish with sauce in the side. I enjoyed that the sauce was on the side so I could customize it to my liking. They also brought out complimentary bread on before the meal which was fresh and addicting. My coworker stated that the cornbread he got with his meal was excellent.  The restaurant had a very modern decor with fish art hanging from the ceiling and an artsy palm tree. Ceiling was high, so restraint felt very open and even though it was crowded, it never felt like the place got too loud.  Service was terrific.

The fish was delicious as it is hard to screw up cod but the batter was soggy and there could have been more fish especially for the price you pay.  NOTE:  The french fries were really good and abundant.  I am defiantly going to have to go back at some point to try some thing else as most places who do a beer batter for fish ends up soggy since beer is not really meant for deep frying which is why it does not get crunchy and flaky like how I make my fish ... don!!!\n",
